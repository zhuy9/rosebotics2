4. Individually, do one of the following:
  -- In rosebotics.py:
       -- Methods to make the robot go forwards and backwards
            a given number of seconds.
       -- Methods to make the robot spin left and spin right
            a given number of degrees
       -- Methods to make the robot turn left and turn right
            a given number of degrees
   -- In your   username.py   file:  testing code for a teammate's code.
